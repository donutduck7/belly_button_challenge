Belly Button Washing Frequency Dashboard
Overview
This project aims to visualize belly button washing frequency data using a Dash web application. The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals' belly button microbes, including their washing frequencies. The dashboard provides an interactive way to explore and understand the relationship between belly button washing frequency and microbial diversity.

Features
Input Field: Users can input their belly button washing frequency into the provided input field.
Gauge Chart: An interactive gauge chart dynamically updates based on the user's input to display the washing frequency.
Bubble Chart: Visualizes the microbial species present in the belly button samples. The size of each bubble represents the abundance of the microbial species, and the color indicates the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) ID.
Bar Graph: Displays the top 10 microbial species found in the selected belly button sample. Users can select different samples from the dropdown menu to view the corresponding data.
Sample Metadata: Displays demographic information about the selected sample, including ID, ethnicity, gender, age, and location.
Interactive Dashboard: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for exploring the data.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Dash: A Python framework for building web applications.
Plotly: A graphing library for creating interactive visualizations.
